Realy simple app that allows basic control of Yeelight bulbs through tray icon.

## Features
- Toggle
- Day mode
- Night mode

## Current Limitations
- There is no option to change values.
- Controls all the lights in the local network.
- Occasionally the lights can't be controlled and need to be turned off/on, and even that rarely works.
  - Can't figure this bug out due to many variables in my setup - it's working, or nothing is working.
